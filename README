This is a program that solves knight's tour puzzles.

debug log:
	^make check for unused space after checking for bounds of array
	^The solutions are correct up until the last two steps, where it
		prints the last step on the second to last step, and a -1
		on the last step

To come:
	control of board size with arrow keys.
	control of where the knight starts.
	better readability/options for display
